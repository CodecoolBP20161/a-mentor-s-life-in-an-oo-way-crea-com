# The Story:

We start with introducing the class to the user.
It's a Monday morning, so ```energy level``` of the students are very low.
The mentors suggest them to ```drink coffee```, which increases their ```energy ``` and everybody ```feels energized```.
The mentors have to use the ```gong``` to get the students ```attention```.
The ```attendance check``` begins but a lot of students are absent due to the match the last night.
This makes the mentors ```feel sad```.
The mentors ```share their knowledge```, about the tasks to do today, which makes them ```feel proud```.
Also the ```knowledge``` of the class increases as well.
A ```Dojo``` begins which increases the ```confidence``` of the class, but their ```energy level falls```.
Creepy guy ```arrives``` to the office, which makes the Mentors ```feel nervous```.
So far he seems to act friendly.
The ```lunch break begins``` which increases the ```energy level``` of everyone.
Mentors have to get the class ```attention``` again, so they use the one and almighty ```gong```.
The coffee machine starts ```beeping```, which drives everyone ```crazy```, so a mentor have to ```fix``` it.
When the coffee machine ```works``` again everyone will become ```happy```.
Mentors start ```checking the progress``` made by students. They are really ```proud``` with what they see.
Creepy guy starts ```creeping around``` the office, the mentors start to feel a bit ```uncomfortable```.
At the end of the day mentors ```give feedback``` to the class, which makes the class really ```happy```.
After that they get ```feedback``` from creepy guy, who is ```satisfied``` with what he saw. The mentors feel ```relieved```.
After school they do what they like in their free time. Miki goes cycling, Tomi goes wall-climbing and Dani watches
Star Wars.
